# orsie_app
The main ORSIE app for the Research Day 2020

### Update [24 Dec 2019]
  
  -- At the moment, this app just demonstrate how to retrive, search and store the data to/from a database.
  
  -- The database and the services that connect the app to the database are located on my servers. You can see the links in the JS file.
  
  -- All the data is retrived and stored using the JS fetch().
  
  -- The services are set up so that you do not need to run the app (html and JS) on a live server. You can edit and run the app locally while still maintaining the connection to the server.
 
 -- Consider the _test.js_ and _test.html_ as the references and do not edit them on the github.
 
 -- Do not edit the services as it will have no effect on the app. They need to be modified on the server.
 
 -- Start coding in the **_index.js_**, **_style.css_**, and **_main.js_** files as needed.
